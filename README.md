### Summary and Recommendations

#### 1. Overview

This Python code is part of a project aimed at analyzing a dataset related to NBA player performance. The goal of the project is to explore player statistics, identify trends in performance, and visualize key insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The code uses Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization.

#### 2. Data

The dataset consists of 12,187 movies, with attributes including:

  - Budget: Movie production budget
  - Revenue: Total revenue generated by the movie
  - Vote Average: The average user rating of the movie
  - Genres: The genres that each movie belongs to
  - Release Date: The release date of the movie

#### 3. Data Analysis Steps

1. Initial Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Outlier Detection
4. Data Visualization

#### 4. Data Cleaning 

- Columns with excessive missing values (e.g., Minutes Per Game, Offensive Rebounds, and Defensive Rebounds) were removed to maintain data quality.
- Missing values in numerical columns were filled with the column mean.
- Team names were standardized from abbreviations (e.g., MIL to Milwaukee Bucks).

#### 5. Data Visualization

- Scatter Plot of assists vs turnovers by player position.
- Bar Plot showing average assists per game by position.
- Correlation Heatmap displaying the relationships between player metrics.
- Boxplots for outlier detection in assists and turnovers.

#### 6. Key Findings
      
Relationship Between Assists and Turnovers: Guards tend to have higher assists but also accumulate more turnovers due to their ball-handling role, as shown in the scatter plot.

Average Assists Per Game by Position: Guards had the highest average assists per game, followed by forwards and centers, as shown in the bar plot.

Outliers in Assists and Turnovers: Boxplots of assists and turnovers indicate potential outliers in the dataset. These could represent standout performances or data inconsistencies that may need further investigation.

Correlation Between Player Metrics: The correlation matrix reveals that certain metrics, like points and assists, are positively correlated, suggesting that players who pass the ball effectively may also score more points.
